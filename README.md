This is the frontend for simple a cloud portal. This was a school project for the VM2 class. This doesn't reflect the best of my abilities. I was working with a strict deadline while the features in this frontend far exceed the requirements.

# Features!

  - A cover page to welcome customers.
  - A user management system where each customer gets their own account.
  - A dashboard to manage all the customer's systems.
  - Filters to only show a particular environment.
  - CRUD integration to manage systems, environments, and customers.
  - A built-in file editor to customize deployments.
  - A backup shell script with minimal functionality to manage deployments.
  - Included Docker Compose file.

### Tech

The VM2 portal uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [PHP] - A popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.
* [Bootstrap] - The most popular HTML, CSS, and JS library in the world.
* [Pheditor] - A single-file editor and file manager written in PHP.
* [php-yaml] - Support for YAML 1.1 (YAML Ain't Markup Language) serialization using the LibYAML library.
* [jQuery] - The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library.
* [Popper] - Popper is the de facto standard to position tooltips and popovers in modern web applications.
* [Feather] - Simply beautiful open source icons.

### Installation

The VM2 portal requires [PHP] v7 and [php-yaml] to run.

Install the dependencies and start the server.
